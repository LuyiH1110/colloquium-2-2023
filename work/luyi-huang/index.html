            <h2>Design Proposal</h2>
            <p>This is a proposal about redefining architectural and urban systems to achieve low carbon emissions.
Currently, most of the land in US is Suburban Context. However, compared to people living in a carless urban context, the residents living in the suburban context produce 4 times more carbon footprint every year. One of reasons is because the more centralized city form allows people to consume less energy consumption on daily transportation.
There are three scales/ideas/directions for this project
1. Centralize the city to only use Half Land Occupation (urban)
2. Vertical block which will create a new urban community and social context (building)
3. Robotic housing unit will bring in the idea of Half Size Home (units/floor plan/ interior)

The global warming comes much faster than everybody thought. It is urgent, it does not have time to wait.
Here is a new prototype for an architectural and urban planning system to reduce half of the floor area of buildings and reduce half of the daily transportation distance in order to achieve half of the carbon footprint in 50 years.
